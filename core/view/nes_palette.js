/*
The NES could select 4 palettes each containing one of these colors to be applied to the background.
(however, color 0 of each palette has to be the same, so technically, 13 different colors are available at a time)

A background palette is applied to a 16x16 pixel area,
however through a special video mode of the MMC5 mapper it is possible for every 8x8 pixel tile to have its individual palette.

As for sprites, 4 different palettes can be used at a time (with color 0 being transparent in each)
and every 8x8 or 8x16 pixels can have their own palette, allowing for a total of 12 different colors to use for sprites at any given time.
